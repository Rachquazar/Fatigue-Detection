# Fatigue-Detection

This repo consists of:

PART 1: <br>
A MATLAB application code which inputs a video and extracts eye-blinks of the user, using a statistical 'EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)' custom metric based method.
It is an extension of the works of [1] and [2].

PART 2: <br>
A custom Convolutional Neural Network (VGG based) to train a drowsiness/fatigue detection model based upon input face images.
(Python Script, using Keras with TensorFlow as backend).
